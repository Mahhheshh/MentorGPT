    "5": {
        "question": "what is an lambda function?",
        "answer": "Lambda functions in Python are anonymous functions that are defined using the `lambda` keyword. They are a shorthand way of defining small, throw-away functions without the need to write a named function. Lambda functions can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression. This expression is evaluated and returned when the lambda function is called. Here is an example of a lambda function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:\n\n```\nsum = lambda x, y: x + y\n```\nHere, `sum` is a lambda function that takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns their sum."

        "question": "httpx or requests, which one is good?",
        "answer": "Both `httpx` and `requests` are good libraries for making HTTP requests in Python. Here are some key differences between the two:\n\n1. `httpx` is relatively new compared to `requests` and claims to be faster and more efficient due to its asynchronous design.\n\n2. `httpx` supports both synchronous and asynchronous requests, whereas `requests` only supports synchronous requests.\n\n3. `httpx` has a stricter API design and is more consistent with how it handles errors and exceptions.\n\n4. `requests` has a larger community and more resources available online, so it might be easier to find help and examples.\n\nIn summary, both libraries are good and can be used depending on your requirements. If you need async support or want a more consistent API design, then `httpx` might be a better choice. Otherwise, `requests` works just as well for most use cases."

        "answer": "Sure, `requests` is a Python library that allows us to send HTTP/1.1 requests easily with different methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, PATCH, and OPTIONS. We can also specify headers, form data, files, and parameters for our requests.\n\nTo use `requests` module, we first need to install it by running the following command in our terminal or command prompt:\n```\npip install requests\n```\n\nHere's an example of using `requests` module to send a GET request:\n\n```Python\nimport requests\n\nresponse = requests.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')\nprint(response.content)\n```\n\nIn this example, we are sending a GET request to retrieve a single ToDo item from a JSONPlaceholder API endpoint using `requests.get()` method. We access the content of the response using `response.content` attribute which returns a bytes object. The response is encoded in `UTF-8` and we can easily decode it to string using `response.content.decode(\"utf-8\")`. \n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any more doubts."

        "question": "what is use of async functions",
        "answer": "Async functions are used in Python to execute code asynchronously, which means that the code won't wait for a particular task to complete before moving on to the next task. In other words, async functions can do multiple things in parallel.\n\nAsync functions are particularly useful when we have to work with long-running or blocking activities like making HTTP requests or reading files from disk. We can use async functions to schedule these blocking activities in a non-blocking way so that our application doesn't get stuck waiting for the response from these activities. This ability to execute multiple tasks in parallel can improve the performance of our applications, especially when they involve input/output (I/O) operations. \n\nAsync functions are typically used in conjunction with an event loop, which is an asynchronous programming pattern that provides a way to track and manage the progress of multiple tasks in parallel. Python's asyncio module provides an event loop and other tools for writing asynchronous code.\n\nIn summary, the main use of async functions is to improve the performance of our applications by enabling them to execute multiple tasks in parallel in a non-blocking way."

    },
    "22": {
        "question": "how to unlock multithreading with python\n",
        "answer": "Python provides built-in support for multithreading through a `threading` module. The idea of multithreading is to execute multiple threads, each performing a specific task, simultaneously. Here's a simple example code that demonstrates the use of multithreading in Python:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\ndef function1():\n    print(\"Executing function 1\")\n\ndef function2():\n    print(\"Executing function 2\")\n\n# Create threads\nt1 = threading.Thread(target=function1)\nt2 = threading.Thread(target=function2)\n\n# Start threads\nt1.start()\nt2.start()\n\n# Wait for threads to complete\nt1.join()\nt2.join()\n\nprint(\"Finished\")\n```\n\nIn the above code, two functions `function1()` and `function2()` are executed simultaneously using two separate threads `t1` and `t2`. The `start()` method is used to start each thread and the `join()` method is used to wait for the threads to complete before moving on to the next line of code.\n\nNote that multithreading can be tricky to implement correctly and can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior if not used properly. It's important to read up on the use of locks and other synchronization methods to prevent threads from accessing shared resources concurrently."

In the second example, `double_lambda` is a lambda function that takes a single argument `x`, and returns its double. \n\nYou can use lambda functions in place of regular functions in situations where you need a simple, concise function to be executed only once."

        "answer": "To check if a string is palindrome or not, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Take the input string from the user.\n2. Initialize two pointers, one pointer pointing to the beginning of the string and the other at the end.\n3. Traverse the string from both ends, comparing the characters at each iteration.\n4. If all the characters match, the string is a palindrome, else it is not.\n\nYou can use a loop to compare the characters at each iteration. There are multiple ways to implement this, using if statement or a while loop."
